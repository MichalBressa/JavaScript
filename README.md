 The Rock Paper Scissors game. It uses prompts to get user input and console to write results of the game. 
 I used Map to make choice table: if player inputs ROCK then value assigned to it is 0. Other Map represents relation between choices: paper beats rock etc. 
 Use of Maps allowed me to avoid necesity of applying multiple if statments and simplified my code.
